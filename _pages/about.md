I received the M.Eng, and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from Northeast Normal University (NENU), Jilin, China, in 2012, and 2015, respectively. Currently, I’m a professor in School of Artificial Intelligence, Jilin University, Jilin, China. From 2015/11 to 2016/11, I visited the University of Surrey as an academic visitor. From 2017/3 to 2019/3, I worked as the senior researcher at the City University of Hong Kong. I have published more than 100 technical papers at prominent journals such as Bioinformatics, Briefing in Bioinformatics, NAR, IEEE TCYB, IEEE JBHI, IEEE TCBB, IEEE TNB, IEEE TEM, etc. I am particularly interested in bioinformatics, applied deep learning, applied data mining, computational intelligence, and Natural Computing. 


**Recruiting: I am always looking for self-motivated Master and PhD students to do cutting edge research on Bioinformatics & applied deep learning. Each year, one PhD studentship (Only for bioinformatics & applied deep learning) and four Master studentships can be available. If interested, please email your full CV to me for consideration (E-mail: lixt314@jlu.edu.cn).**
