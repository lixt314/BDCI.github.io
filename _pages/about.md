## Brief Bio  
I am a Professor at the **School of Artificial Intelligence, Jilin University** working at the intersection of **artificial intelligence (AI)** and **computational biology**. I received my M.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from Northeast Normal University in 2012 and 2015, respectively.  
- **2015 – 2016:** Academic Visitor, University of Surrey, UK  
- **2017 – 2019:** Senior Research Associate, City University of Hong Kong  
- **2020 – Present:** Professor & Principal Investigator, Jilin University  

## Research Highlights  
My research bridges artificial intelligence and bioinformatics, focusing on cutting-edge AI for Science applications. My work addresses critical problems in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data analysis, and protein–RNA interaction prediction, aiming to uncover new biological insights through advanced algorithms.
