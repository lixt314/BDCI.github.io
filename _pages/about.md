I received the M.Eng, and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from Northeast Normal University (NENU), Jilin, China, in 2012, and 2015, respectively. Currently, I’m a professor in School of Artificial Intelligence, Jilin University, Jilin, China. From 2015/11 to 2016/11, I visited the University of Surrey as an academic visitor. I am now working as senior research associate at the City University of Hong Kong. I am particularly interested in bioinformatics, computational intelligence, and system biology. 



**From 1st December 2019, I will join the School of Artificial Intelligence, Jilin University as a Professor.**
**Each year, one PhD studentship and four Master studentships can be available. If you are interested, please send me an email (lixt314@jlu.edu.cn). Many thanks!**

# 本人现在每年可招收博士研究生一名(2019年底可招生），硕士研究生四名。请感兴趣的同学把简历发到我的邮箱(lixt314@jlu.edu.cn)
