## Brief Bio  
I am a Professor at the **School of Artificial Intelligence, Jilin University** working at the intersection of **artificial intelligence (AI)** and **computational biology**. I received my M.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from Northeast Normal University in 2012 and 2015, respectively.  
- **2015 – 2016:** Academic Visitor, University of Surrey, UK  
- **2017 – 2019:** Senior Research Associate, City University of Hong Kong  
- **2020 – Present:** Professor & Principal Investigator, Jilin University  

## Research Highlights  
Our group, grounded in computational methodologies, focuses on employing advanced deep-learning techniques to decode complex biological and biomedical datasets. Our contributions include: (1). Single-cell RNA-seq, Multi-omics, and Spatial transcriptomics: By harnessing state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, our group has pioneered methods to analyze single-cell RNA sequencing data. Venturing further into multi-omics and spatial transcriptomics, we strive to uncover the intricate molecular layers within cells, shedding light on the spatial intricacies of transcriptional processes. (2). Protein-RNA Binding Predictions: An integral part of our research involves predicting Protein-RNA interactions. Utilizing deep learning methodologies, we have developed precise models that accurately predict these molecular dialogues, opening avenues for the discovery of innovative diagnostic markers and potential therapeutic strategies.
