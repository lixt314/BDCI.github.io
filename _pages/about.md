I received the M.Eng, and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from Northeast Normal University (NENU), Jilin, China, in 2012, and 2015, respectively. Currently, I’m a professor in School of Artificial Intelligence, Jilin University, Jilin, China. From 2015/11 to 2016/11, I visited the University of Surrey as an academic visitor. I am now working as senior research associate at the City University of Hong Kong. I am particularly interested in bioinformatics, computational intelligence, and system biology. 


**Recruiting: I am always looking for self-motivated Master and PhD students to do cutting edge research on Evolutionary algorithm & Mulitobjective Optimization, Bioinformatics & Machine learning. Each year, one PhD studentship and four Master studentships can be available. If interested, please email your full CV to me for consideration (E-mail: lixt314@jlu.edu.cn).**

**博士和硕士招生说明**：主要研究方向：进化计算，多目标进化，生物信息学及机器学习。本人现在每年可招收博士研究生一名，硕士研究生四名。
