I received the M.Eng, and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from Northeast Normal University (NENU), Jilin, China, in 2012, and 2015, respectively. Currently, I’m a professor in School of Artificial Intelligence, Jilin University, Jilin, China. From 2015/11 to 2016/11, I visited the University of Surrey as an academic visitor. I am now working as senior research associate at the City University of Hong Kong. I am particularly interested in bioinformatics, computational intelligence, and system biology. 



**From 1st December 2019, I will join the School of Artificial Intelligence, Jilin University as a Professor.**

**Recruiting: I am always looking for self-motivated Master and PhD students to do cutting edge research on Evolutionary algorithm & Mulitobjective Optimization, Bioinformatics & Machine learning. Each year, one PhD studentship and four Master studentships can be available. If interested, please email your full CV to me for consideration (E-mail: lixt314@jlu.edu.cn).**

**博士和硕士招生说明**：主要研究方向：进化计算，多目标进化，生物信息学及机器学习。本人现在每年可招收博士研究生一名(2019年可招生两名博士生，名额已满），硕士研究生四名。欢迎有志从事科研、勇于挑战、有责任心的同学报考！读研和读博期间表现优秀者，将额外提供科研补贴并优先考虑海内外学术交流(全额资助)。态度和责任心决定高度，效率决定成败！

**特别说明**：发送E-mail(lixt314@jlu.edu.cn)时，**邮件主题**请按照如下格式:**“20XX年博士或硕士导师申请-姓名-硕士与本科学校名称”**，邮件内容需体现个人研究经历、成果、英语水平和预期目标等.
